# Python Fundamentals 
 
The repository contains different functions and examples that demonstrates python concentps like such as Functions, Decorators, Sequences, Sets, Dictionaries and Object-Oriented Programming based on flatiron school 

# Project Overview
The code includes the following Python concepts: 
Basic Data Structures
Functions
Decorators
Tuples
Dictionaries
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

# Functions 
# 1. add_numbers
A function named add_numbers that takes two parameters num1 and num2, and returns their sum 

# 2. is_even 
the function takes a single parameter number and returns True if even and False otherwise.

# 3. reverse_string
The function takes a string text as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

# 4. count_vowels
The function that takes a string text as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a string. 

# 5. calculate_factorial 
The function takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

# 6. Decorators: apply_decorator 
The function that takes a function (func) as input and applies a decorator named decorator_func. The decorator prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

# 7.uples: Function name_age_tuple 
The functions provides the list of tuples with each name and age, and sorts the list of tuple by age in ascending order. It uses the sorted() and key=lambda x:x[1] to sort the tuple list. 

# 8. Dictionaries/ Merged the dictionaries

The function merge_dicts that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If a key is present in both dictionaries, the values are extended.

# 9. Class Creation: OOP 
The code contains a class function Car, with the attributes: make, model, year. it includes a method named display_info and print out car's information. 

# Prequisite
1. Have Python 3.8.13 installed 
2. Pipfile package manager 

# Environments
None needed environment for this code. 

# Run code 
To run the code use python pythonfund.py 
No test included in the projects.
